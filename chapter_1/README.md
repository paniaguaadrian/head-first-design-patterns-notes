# CHAPTER ONE - THE STRATEGY PATTERN

On this chapter we faced a refactor of the SimUDuck app (an app that generates ducks that can fly and quack).
After using OO to resolve the challenge, we saw that the best refactor possible was the Strategy Pattern, where in a few words, we isolated behaviors like Fly and Quack, so we can even set if a duck can or not fly, or does quack or silence, at runtime.

## Strategy Pattern definition

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Test the chapter

If you want to see the stages of this challenge from OO to Strategy Pattern, you can navigate on the commits and run the DuckTestDriven.java class (created to test the solutions).
